# 🏛 System Architecture

CopCode follows a **modern full-stack client-server architecture** designed for scalability, low-latency collaboration, and modular development. Instead of relying on a monolithic application, the system separates responsibilities into independent layers that communicate through REST APIs and WebSockets.

The platform consists of five primary layers:

```
                         ┌────────────────────────────┐
                         │        Browser Client      │

- Testing

---

# ⚡ Backend Architecture

The backend is built using **Express.js** and follows a layered architecture.

``
Client
↓
Routes
↓
Controllers
↓
Services
↓
Database Models
↓
MongoDB
```

Each layer has a single responsibility.

### Routes

Responsible for receiving HTTP requests.

Example

```
POST /login
POST /register
POST /create-room
POST /execute
```

---

### Controllers

Controllers contain request validation and business flow.

Responsibilities include
- Request Validation
- Response Handling
- Error Handling
- Authentication

---

### Services

The service layer performs the application's business logic.

Examples

- Create Room
- Join Room
- Execute Code
- Export Project
- Update Profile
- Reset Password

---

### Models

Models communicate with MongoDB.

Examples

```
User
Room
File
Message
Workspace
```

---

# 📁 File System Design

CopCode supports a hierarchical project structure similar to Visual Studio Code.

Example

```
Project
│
├── src
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
│   ├── components
│   └── pages
│
├── public
│
├── package.json
│
└── README.md
```

Supported Operations

✅ Create File
✅ Rename File
✅ Delete File
✅ Create Folder
✅ Nested Directories
✅ Multiple Open Tabs

✅ File Metadata

---

# 🧠 Personal Workspace

One of the unique features of CopCode is the **Personal Workspace**.

Unlike traditional collaborative editors where every change is immediately visible, CopCode allows each user to maintain a private coding area.

### Benefits

- Draft ideas
- Experiment
- Debug privately
- Compare implementation
- Practice before publishing

This reduces accidental edits while encouraging experimentation.

---

# 🌐 Real-Time Synchronization

Synchronization is powered by

- Socket.io
- Yjs
- CRDT

The synchronization process follows these steps.

```
User Types
↓
Monaco Editor
↓
Yjs Update
↓
Socket Emit
↓
Server
↓
Broadcast
↓
Remote Clients
↓
Apply Update
↓
Editor Updated
```

---

# 🧠 Why CRDT?

Traditional collaborative systems use Operational Transformation (OT).

CopCode instead uses CRDT because it provides:

- Eventual Consistency
- Automatic Conflict Resolution
- Offline Editing
- Better Scalability
- Lower Latency
- Simpler Synchronization

Unlike Git merges, CRDT ensures that simultaneous edits are merged automatically without requiring manual conflict resolution.

- Chat History
- Online Users
- Workspace Metadata

The room owner can manage project resources while members collaborate in real time.

---

# 📡 REST API Documentation

The backend exposes a RESTful API that handles authentication, room management, file operations, code execution, and profile management.

## Authentication APIs

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|---------|----------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Register a new user | ❌ |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate user | ❌ |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Logout current session | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Get logged-in user | ✅ |
| PUT | `/api/auth/profile` | Update profile | ✅ |
| POST | `/api/auth/forgot-password` | Send reset email | ❌ |
| POST | `/api/auth/reset-password/:token` | Reset password | ❌ |

### Registration Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant React
    participant Express
    participant MongoDB

    User->>React: Fill registration form
    React->>Express: POST /register
    Express->>Express: Validate Input
    Express->>Express: Hash Password (bcrypt)
    Express->>MongoDB: Save User
    MongoDB-->>Express: User Created
    Express-->>React: JWT Cookie
    React-->>User: Redirect to Dashboard
```

### Login Request

```http
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email":"john@example.com",
  "password":"********"
}
```

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "user": {
    "_id": "...",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

# 🗂 Room Management

The Room module is the heart of CopCode. Every collaborative session is isolated inside a room identified by a unique Room ID.

## Features

- Create room
- Join room
- Leave room
- Invite collaborators
- Online member tracking
- Owner permissions
- Shared editor state
- Room chat
- File explorer
- Workspace synchronization

## Room Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Create Room] --> B[Generate Unique Room ID]
B --> C[Store Metadata in MongoDB]
C --> D[Owner Joins]
D --> E[Members Join]
E --> F[Initialize Socket]
F --> G[Load File Tree]
G --> H[Load Yjs State]
H --> I[Start Collaboration]
```

### Room Document Schema

```javascript
{
   _id,
   roomId,
   roomName,
   owner,
   members[],
   onlineUsers[],
   fileTree,
   createdAt,
   updatedAt
}
```

## Why Room-Based Architecture?

Unlike global collaborative editors, CopCode isolates each project inside its own room. This prevents cross-project synchronization, improves scalability, simplifies authorization, and allows independent collaboration sessions.

---

# 📂 File System Architecture

Instead of storing a single source file, CopCode maintains a complete hierarchical file system.

```text
Room
├── src
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
│   ├── components
│   ├── hooks
│   ├── pages
│   └── utils
├── public
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

Each file maintains metadata including its name, parent folder, extension, language, creator, timestamps, and associated Yjs document state.

CRUD operations are synchronized through Socket.io so every collaborator sees updates immediately.

| Operation | Socket Event |
|-----------|--------------|
| Create File | `create-file` |
| Rename File | `rename-file` |
| Delete File | `delete-file` |
| Create Folder | `create-folder` |
| Delete Folder | `delete-folder` |

---

# 🗄 Database Design

CopCode uses **MongoDB Atlas** as the primary database. The database is designed to keep user information, collaboration rooms, file metadata, chat messages, and shared document states persistent across sessions. Instead of storing everything in a single collection, the application separates concerns into multiple collections for better scalability and maintainability.

## Database Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Users | Stores user account information |
| Rooms | Stores room metadata and members |
| FileContents | Stores code files and Yjs document state |
| Messages | Stores room chat history |
| RecentRooms | Stores recently accessed rooms |

---

## 👤 User Schema

The User collection stores authentication credentials and profile information.

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
  avatar: String,
  bio: String,
  recentRooms: [ObjectId],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Responsibilities

- User Authentication
- Profile Management
- Avatar Storage
- Recent Room History
- Password Reset

---

## 🏠 Room Schema

Each collaborative session is represented by a Room document.

```javascript
{
   _id:ObjectId,
   roomId:String,
   roomName:String,
   owner:ObjectId,
   members:[ObjectId],
   onlineUsers:[ObjectId],
   files:[ObjectId],
   createdAt:Date,
   updatedAt:Date
}
```

### Room Features

- Unique Room ID
- Room Ownership
- Member Management
- Active Users
- File Tree
- Shared Workspace
- Chat Association

---

## 📄 File Schema

Instead of storing code directly inside the Room document, CopCode stores files independently.

```javascript
{
   _id:ObjectId,
   room:ObjectId,
   name:String,
   language:String,
   parent:String,
   yjsState:Buffer,
   content:String,
   createdBy:ObjectId
}
```

### Why Separate File Storage?

Keeping files independent provides several advantages:

- Faster queries
- Better scalability
- Smaller room documents
- Easier synchronization
- Independent file loading

---

## 💬 Chat Schema

```javascript
{
   sender:ObjectId,
   room:ObjectId,
   message:String,
   createdAt:Date
}
```

Each message belongs to exactly one collaboration room.

Only recent messages are loaded initially to improve performance.

---

# 📡 Real-Time Communication

Real-time collaboration is implemented using **Socket.io**.

Unlike HTTP, WebSockets maintain a persistent connection between client and server.

This enables:

- Instant code synchronization
- Live chat
- Presence updates
- File synchronization
- Cursor updates
- Typing indicators

---

## Socket Connection Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User
participant React
participant Socket

User->>React: Join Room
React->>Socket: Connect
Socket->>Server: Authenticate JWT
Server->>Room: Add User

```

---

# 📡 Socket Events

| stop-typing | Remove typing status |

---

# ⚡ Yjs Collaboration Engine

One of the biggest challenges in collaborative applications is synchronizing simultaneous edits.

Traditional collaborative systems often suffer from:

- Merge conflicts
- Lost updates
- Race conditions
- File locking

CopCode solves these issues using **Yjs**, an implementation of **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**.

---

## How Yjs Works

Whenever a user edits the document:

1. Monaco Editor detects changes.
2. Changes are converted into Yjs updates.
3. Updates are transmitted through Socket.io.
4. Server broadcasts updates.
5. Every connected client applies the same update.
6. All editors converge to the same document state.

Unlike Git, there is no manual merge process.

---

## Collaboration Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
A[Developer A] --> C[Yjs Document]
B[Developer B] --> C
D[Developer C] --> C
C --> E[Socket.io]
E --> F[Server]
F --> G[Broadcast]
G --> H[All Connected Clients]
```

---

## Benefits of CRDT

| Feature | Traditional Sync | Yjs |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Merge Conflicts | ❌ Possible | ✅ Eliminated |
| Offline Editing | ❌ Limited | ✅ Supported |
| Automatic Merge | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Scalability | Medium | High |
| Latency | Medium | Low |

---

The workspace is isolated from the shared editor and allows users to:

- Experiment safely
- Test algorithms
- Draft implementations
- Compare solutions
- Prepare code before sharing

This feature significantly reduces accidental modifications while encouraging experimentation.

---
